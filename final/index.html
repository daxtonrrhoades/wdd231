                <h3>Original Trilogy</h3>
                <p>A farmboy named Luke Skywalker is sent by Old Ben, also known as Obi Wan Kenobi, to rescue princess
                    Leia
                    who
                    has been taken hostage by Darth Vader.</p>
                <p>He is accompanied by the Captain of the Millenium Falcon, Han Solo, and his fuzzy friend Chewbacca
                    along
                    with
                    Old Ben and the droids, R2D2 and C3PO.</p>
                <p>On the Death Star Obi Wan Sacrifices himself to get the others to their ship safely and stays behind
                    with
                    Vader and falls at his hand.</p>
                <p>In the next film, we start on the snowy planet Hoth and Luke and his friends are attacked by Imperial
                    forces
                    commanded by Darth Vader.</p>
                <p>Luke travels to Dagobah to learn the ways of the Jedi and meets Yoda, an old friend of Ben and a
                    Jedi
                    Master
                    who will teach Luke.</p>
                <p>Luke is influenced by the force to go help his friends and there he learns that Darth Vader is his
                    father.
                    Han is also frozen in Carbonite.</p>
                <p>In the next film Luke is determined to bring his father back to the light side. He returns to Dagobah
                    to
                    finish his training and Yoda passes away.</p>
                <p>Han is freed from Carbonite at Jabba's Palace and Luke is thrown into the Rancor's pit to be eaten
                    up.
                    Luke
                    is victorious and they escape the palace.</p>
                <p>Luke is put up against Vader and his master the Emperor as Luke's friends plan to blow up the
                    second
                    Death
                    Star</p>
                <p>Luke convinces Vader there is still good in him and together they defeat Sidious. Though due to being
                    electricuted Vader does not survive</p>
